-- Write a script that lists all shows, and all genres linked to that show, from the database hbtn_0d_tvshows.
-- If a show doesnâ€™t have a genre, display NULL in the genre column
-- Each record should display: tv_shows.title - tv_genres.name
-- Results must be sorted in ascending order by the show title and genre name
